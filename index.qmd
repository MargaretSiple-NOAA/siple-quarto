# About

Welcome to my Quarto webpage! I am working on filling it out. The page is public. The source code for this website is [here](https://github.com/MargaretSiple-NOAA/siple-quarto). 

# Research

## Marine mammal bycatch impacts
The marine mammal bycatch working group is a collaboration between academics and scientists from inside and outside NOAA, supported by [The Ocean Modeling Forum](https://oceanmodelingforum.org/). My primary contribution to this project was the mmrefpoints R package and Shiny app.

# Teaching

## Shiny tutorials
I have several Shiny tutorials, hosted in various places.

I learned how to use Quarto from Openscapes and R-Ladies Santa Barbara.
