# About

Welcome to my Quarto webpage! I am working on filling it out. The page is public. The source code for this website is [here](https://github.com/MargaretSiple-NOAA/siple-quarto). 

# Research

## Marine mammal bycatch impacts
The Marine Mammal Bycatch Working Group is a collaboration between academics and scientists from inside and outside NOAA, supported by [The Ocean Modeling Forum](https://oceanmodelingforum.org/). My primary contribution to this project was the `{mmrefpoints}` [R package](https://github.com/mcsiple/mmrefpoints) and Shiny app. I contributed to this work as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Washington.

For more information about this project and work products, including links to talks and tutorials, visit the [Marine mammal bycatch page](current-projects/bycatch.qmd).




# Teaching

## Shiny tutorials

Materials for most of my `{shiny}` materials are collected on the [Teaching](teaching.qmd) page.

```{r}
#some stuff

I learned how to use Quarto from Openscapes and R-Ladies Santa Barbara.
