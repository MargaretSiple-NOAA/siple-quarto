# About

Welcome to my Quarto webpage! I am working on filling it out. The page is public. The source code for this website is [here](https://github.com/MargaretSiple-NOAA/siple-quarto). 

# Research

I will use this page mostly to host materials for ongoing academic projects and teaching materials. 

## Postdoctoral projects





# Teaching

## Shiny tutorials

Materials for most of my `{shiny}` materials are collected on the [Teaching](teaching.qmd) page.

```{r}
#some stuff
library(RColorBrewer)
RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n = 5,"Blues")

I learned how to use Quarto from Openscapes and R-Ladies Santa Barbara.
