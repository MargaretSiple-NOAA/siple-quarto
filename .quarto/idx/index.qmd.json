I am a Research Fish Biologist at NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center, in the Groundfish Assessment Program. I built this page to host teaching and research materials that others may need easy access to. It is very much a work in progress.\n\nThe page is public. The source code for this website is [here](https://github.com/MargaretSiple-NOAA/siple-quarto). \n\n# Research\n\nIn GAP, I work on the development of indices of abundance for stock assessment, and on improving Essential Fish Habitat information for groundfish and invertebrates in Alaska fisheries.\n\n## Postdoctoral projects\n\n### Marine mammal bycatch\nA collaborative project led by the Ocean Modeling Forum at the University of Washington. More info [here](currentprojects/bycatch.qmd).\n\n### The value of ecological information\nA James S. McDonnell Fellowship project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\n### Forage species ecology and management\nMy dissertation topic, but also an ongoing area of exploration. I am interested in how we can better incorporate ecological information (environmental data, predation information, and more) into the models we use for managing forage species.\n\n# Teaching\nMaterials for teaching about data visualization, Shiny, marine ecology, and fisheries management are slowly being assembled in the [Teaching](teaching.qmd) page.\n\n\n\n---\nI learned how to use Quarto from Openscapes and R-Ladies Santa Barbara.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"theme":{"light":["cosmo","theme.scss"],"dark":["cosmo","theme-dark.scss"]},"code-copy":true,"title":"Margaret Siple's quarto page"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
